        <p>I'm a <del>pterodactyl</del> Ruby on Rails developer. At <a href="http://nird.us/" target="_blank">Northwest Independent Ruby Development</a>, I contribute to kick ass Rails apps and help build curricula for corporate trainings. I also work with <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a> to help grow more awesome developers.</p>
